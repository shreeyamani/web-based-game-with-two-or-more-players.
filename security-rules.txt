These are the VERY BASIC rules I used in the firebase.

For example, any logged in player could currently delete all the coins in the game - or write whatever they want to their individual `player` node.


```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": false,
    "players": {
      "$uid": {
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    },
    "coins": {
        ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```
